1. Effective communication is key to a successful project. Regular team meetings, clear communication of individual responsibilities, and transparency in decision making helped us stay on track and avoid misunderstandings.

2. Proper planning and organization is critical to the success of a project. Establishing a timeline, setting achievable goals, and breaking down tasks into smaller steps made the project more manageable and achievable.

3. Flexibility and adaptability are essential traits to possess in a project. Changes in design, scope, or requirements can occur at any time, and it is essential to be able to adjust and pivot accordingly.

4. Thorough research and prototyping are necessary to ensure the feasibility of a project. The process of testing different components and designs allowed us to identify potential problems early on and make necessary adjustments.

5. Attention to detail is crucial in both hardware and software development. Small mistakes or oversights can have significant consequences and lead to time-consuming and costly errors.

6. Collaboration and teamwork are necessary to succeed in a project. Also, having Cadence and practicing working on it is really necessary and helpful for the course. 

7. Failure is a natural part of the learning process. Not all ideas or designs will work, and it is essential to be able to learn from mistakes and move forward.

8. Testing and debugging are time-consuming but necessary processes. Testing our hardware and software at each stage helped us catch errors early and ensure that our final product was functional and met all requirements.

9. Documentation is critical for future reference and replication of the project. Recording our progress, documenting design decisions, and keeping track of changes helped us stay organized and made it easier to communicate our work to others.

10. Continuous learning and improvement are essential for success in any project. The process of working on this project helped us develop new skills, deepen our understanding of various concepts, and reinforced the importance of ongoing education and development.
