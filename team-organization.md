# **1.0 Team Organization** 

## **1.1 Charter**

As a team, we are planning on applying all the knowledge we gained in
electrical and mechanical skills into a new product. Our team will put
full effort into designing a new environmental sensing product that aids
users and is user friendly.

For goals our group would like to:

  - > Create a product that real world customers would consider using.

  - > Build a high value and efficient product and to be easy to
    > manufacture and access for the user.

  - > Focus on our users and make our product easy to understand and
    > use.

  - > Create a new design/idea in the environmental field that focuses
    > on solving a real challenge.

  - > Challenge ourselves to design and build something that could be
    > included on a resum√©.

## **1.2 Product Mission Statement**

Our team mission statement is to improve the clean energy generation
industry, specifically solar energy, and make it more efficient so that
users are able to get the most benefit from their solar energy source.

During the initial stages of developing our team's charter and mission statement, we first engaged in a thorough discussion regarding our overarching goals and objectives. Once we had established a clear understanding of our goals, we then turned our attention toward the project requirements, with the aim of refining our mission statement and charter.

One of the primary considerations that we focused on during this process was the importance of user-friendliness, which we deemed to be a critical aspect of any product design that we would create. With this in mind, we then proceeded to formulate our charter, followed by narrowing down our mission statement to the specific area of solar energy efficiency.

This focus on solar energy efficiency was a result of our efforts to develop a concrete vision for our design, with the understanding that we needed to identify a tangible objective that was achievable within the timeframe of the project. Throughout this process, we remained committed to ensuring that our mission statement and charter remained aligned with our overall goals and objectives, in order to maximize the impact of our efforts.
