# **1.0 Team Organization** 

## **1.1 Charter**

As a team, we are planning on applying all the knowledge we gained in
electrical and mechanical skills into a new product. Our team will put
full effort into designing a new environmental sensing product that aids
users and is user friendly.

For goals our group would like to:

  - > Create a product that real world customers would consider using.

  - > Build a high value and efficient product and to be easy to
    > manufacture and access for the user.

  - > Focus on our users and make our product easy to understand and
    > use.

  - > Create a new design/idea in the environmental field that focuses
    > on solving a real challenge.

  - > Challenge ourselves to design and build something that could be
    > included on a resum√©.

## **1.2 Product Mission Statement**

Our team mission statement is to improve the clean energy generation
industry, specifically solar energy, and make it more efficient so that
users are able to get the most benefit from their solar energy source.

When coming up with the charter and mission statement for our team we
discussed what we wanted our goals to be first. Once we had an idea for
some of our goals we looked at the project requirements and thought of
what we may want our mission statement and charter to be. When
discussing this we wanted to make sure we emphasized the user
friendliness aspect of a product since we felt that would be one of the
most crucial parts of any design we made. After forming the charter we
then specified our mission statement down to solar energy efficiency.
This was because we started to develop an idea of where we may want our
actual design to be, and what was actually achievable in the semester.
