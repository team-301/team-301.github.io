# **8.0 Hardware proposal**

For our hardware proposal we have our microcontroller with multiple test
points for programming and debugging purposes. We also have our
switching regulator circuit, temperature sensor and the ICSP plug in for
programming the microcontroller.

Since we are only two members in the team we only have 2 subsystems the microcontroller and the temperature sensor. The motor driver is not connected to anything because it is just for testing and adding functionality to our project.
