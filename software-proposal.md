# **7.0 Software proposal**

For our software proposal we have our main loop which has
initialization, interrupt enable and, the logic of our code. Since we
only have one subsystem beside the microcontroller which is the
temperature sensor or logic is simple. Our loop keeps measuring the
temperature until it is 25 C then it starts the motors to start
cleaning. For our start cleaning loop we run motor 1 and motor2 to move
the brush horizontally.
