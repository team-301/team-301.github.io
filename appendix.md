## **Communication Procedures**

> Communication between group members will take place on Discord. Thus,
> the team will regularly meet and discuss any updates and plan their
> assignments outline and goals. Moreover, the team will email the
> professor as a communication method with the instructor for guidance
> and inquiries. Zoom/Discord meetings will also be held for updates or
> quick weekday meetups.

## **Meeting Schedule**

Our team availability can be found through this
[link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1qsL_EHei7h-eo-5rombT-5g8ybxEDRhG_eKkYWFzCa4/edit). Initially, we are planning to meet Fridays from 3:00 PM until 5:00 PM.
However, our team will try to discuss and work all the main agenda
through the class time. Additionally, we will hold zoom/Discord meetings
on weekdays to discuss any updates and plan in-person meetings.

**Meeting Coordination**

-   We are going to remind each other by the meetings through discord.

-   The meeting time is based on the [schedule of availabilit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1qsL_EHei7h-eo-5rombT-5g8ybxEDRhG_eKkYWFzCa4/edit) and discussions at least a week before.

-   Our preferred meeting methode is online through discord/zoom if no in-person work is required.

-   Team members need to notify the team if there were any changes to
    their availability schedule to ensure that we are all attending
     the meetings on time.

## **Team Coordination**

-   We set an earlier due date which ranges between 4-24 hours before
     the actual due date and make sure that every team member is
     checked off by the time that we set it.

-   We will ask every team member about their knowledge and what part do
     they think they can do the best based on previous semesters
     projects or any projects that they did before.

-   The assignments will be reviewed and validated by each team member
     before submission to ensure that we have everything as it should
     be.

## **How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members?**

Responsibilities will be discussed among the team members and strengths
will be noted. If no member is strong in an area required by the
project, a team member will be assigned that duty with the expectation
of help from other team members. They will be expected to learn enough
about the responsibility to perform it through the semester.
