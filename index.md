## Project Introduction 
* Today renewable energy is playing a huge role in saving the planet and also acknowledging people about nature. In this project, our team is going to build a functional robot to sense dust, temperature, and humidity, and take action to clean any solar panel or tool that needs regular cleaning for efficiency. Most of us are not aware of how solar panels play a huge role in reducing the footprint pollution around the world. As a team we decided to focus and solve a challenge that will increasingly affect the usage of solar panels.
The project mainly aims to sense and collect data based on how efficient are solar panels and compare the efficiency before and after the cleaning. Moreover, it aims to support and increasingly affect solar panel users and new customers.

## Objectives
* Our project aims to spread the culture of solar panels and make them more efficient for old and new users. Our main goal is to build an easy-to-set-up, lightweight, and good-quality solar panel cleaner that reacts fast whenever it feels a certain quantity of dust. On the other hand, it will be featured with different sensors such as temperature, and humidity sensors.
