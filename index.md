<h1> Introduction </h1>


Today renewable energy is playing a huge role in saving the planet and also acknowledging people about nature. In this project, our team is going to build a functional robot to sense dust, temperature, and humidity, and take action to clean any solar panel or tool that needs regular cleaning for efficiency. Most of us are not aware of how solar panels play a huge role in reducing the footprint of pollution around the world. As a team, we decided to focus on and solve a challenge that will increasingly affect the usage of solar panels.
The project mainly aims to sense and collect data based on how efficient are solar panels and compare the efficiency before and after the cleaning. Moreover, it aims to support and increasingly affect solar panel users and new customers. 



## [1.0 Our Team Organization Strategy](/team-organization)
In this section you will go through our team strategy to keep track of the 
project process and the timeline. Moreover, you will get to know who the team members are and what is their roles.

## [2.0 User Needs, Benchmarking and Requirements](/user-needs)

Starting forward, you will go through the user needs analysis and our
team requirements to build a successful project. Also, this part of the
project will give an overview of the project approach before you go
through the next parts.

## [4.0 Block Diagram](block-diagram)

A block diagram is a graphical representation of a system or process that uses blocks to represent components or stages of the system,
and lines or arrows to show the connections between the blocks. It is a useful tool for visualizing complex 
systems or processes, as it allows for a high-level overview of the components and their relationships.In this 
section you can take a look at how the subsystems in this project will be combined and
function together.

## [5.0 Major Component Selections and Power Budget](/component-selection)

Major component selection and power budgeting are important aspects of system design. Major component 
selection involves choosing the key components that will make up the system, such as processors, sensors,
and communication modules. This selection process involves considering factors such as performance,
compatibility, and cost to ensure that the chosen components will work well together and meet the requirements of the system.

Power budgeting involves estimating the amount of power the system will consume and ensuring 
that the power supply can meet this demand. This involves considering the power consumption
of each component, as well as any external factors such as temperature and voltage 
fluctuations. It is important to balance the power requirements of the system with 
the available power supply to ensure that the system will function properly.

## [6.0 Microcontroller Selection](/microcontroller-selection)

Microcontroller selection is a critical aspect of system design, particularly in embedded systems. Microcontrollers are small, integrated circuits that contain a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals, and are often used to control various components in a system. When selecting a microcontroller, it is important to consider factors such as performance, memory capacity, and the available input/output peripherals, as well as the cost and power requirements of the system.


## [7.0 Software proposal](/software-proposal)

A software proposal is a document that outlines a proposed software solution for a specific problem or need. The proposal typically includes details such as the proposed software architecture, design, implementation approach, and testing methodology.Taking a look into the software proposal will give you a full 
understanding on how the team plan to implement the coding to get a fully functional project.

## [8.0 Hardware proposal](/hardware-proposal)

A hardware proposal, specifically a team schematic, is a document that outlines the proposed hardware solution for a specific project or system. The team schematic typically includes details as the proposed hardware architecture, design, and implementation approach. It may also include a timeline, budget, and resource allocation plan. Taking a look into the hardware proposal will give you a full 
understanding on how exactly the circuits and components will work 
together on the PCB to outcome our final project.
