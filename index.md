<h1> Introduction </h1>

Today renewable energy is playing a huge role in saving the planet and also acknowledging people about nature. In this project, our team is going to build a functional robot to sense dust, temperature, and humidity, and take action to clean any solar panel or tool that needs regular cleaning for efficiency. Most of us are not aware of how solar panels play a huge role in reducing the footprint of pollution around the world. As a team, we decided to focus on and solve a challenge that will increasingly affect the usage of solar panels.
The project mainly aims to sense and collect data based on how efficient are solar panels and compare the efficiency before and after the cleaning. Moreover, it aims to support and increasingly affect solar panel users and new customers. 



## [1.0 Our Team Organization Strategy](/team-organization)
In this section you will go through our team strategy to keep track of the 
project process and the timeline. Moreover, you will get to know who the team members are and what is their roles.

## [4.0 Block Diagram](block-diagram)

A block diagram is a graphical representation of a system or process that uses blocks to represent components or stages of the system,
and lines or arrows to show the connections between the blocks. It is a useful tool for visualizing complex 
systems or processes, as it allows for a high-level overview of the components and their relationships.In this 
section you can take a look at how the subsystems in this project will be combined and
function together.

## [5.0 Major Component Selections and Power Budget](/component-selection)

Major component selection and power budgeting are important aspects of system design. Major component 
selection involves choosing the key components that will make up the system, such as processors, sensors,
and communication modules. This selection process involves considering factors such as performance,
compatibility, and cost to ensure that the chosen components will work well together and meet the requirements of the system.

Power budgeting involves estimating the amount of power the system will consume and ensuring 
that the power supply can meet this demand. This involves considering the power consumption
of each component, as well as any external factors such as temperature and voltage 
fluctuations. It is important to balance the power requirements of the system with 
the available power supply to ensure that the system will function properly.

## [6.0 Microcontroller Selection](/microcontroller-selection)

Microcontroller selection is a critical aspect of system design, particularly in embedded systems. Microcontrollers are small, integrated circuits that contain a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals, and are often used to control various components in a system. When selecting a microcontroller, it is important to consider factors such as performance, memory capacity, and the available input/output peripherals, as well as the cost and power requirements of the system.


## [7.0 Software Implementation](/software-proposal)

A software proposal is a document that outlines a proposed software solution for a specific problem or need. The proposal typically includes details such as the proposed software architecture, design, implementation approach, and testing methodology.Taking a look into the software proposal will give you a full 
understanding on how the team plan to implement the coding to get a fully functional project.

## [8.0 Hardware Implementation](/hardware-proposal)

A hardware proposal, specifically a team schematic, is a document that outlines the proposed hardware solution for a specific project or system. The team schematic typically includes details as the proposed hardware architecture, design, and implementation approach. It may also include a timeline, budget, and resource allocation plan. Taking a look into the hardware proposal will give you a full 
understanding on how exactly the circuits and components will work 
together on the PCB to outcome our final project.

## [9.0 System Verification](/system-verification)

This section has been curated to provide you with a comprehensive overview of the verification status of the electrical systems that are incorporated in our designs. Here, you will find detailed information on the connection of different systems and their corresponding verification status as assessed by our expert teaching team. Our team has diligently evaluated each system for compliance with relevant regulations, performance standards, and maintenance requirements. We understand that ensuring the safety and reliability of electrical systems is of paramount importance, and our aim is to provide a transparent and reliable source of information that can assist property owners, contractors, and other stakeholders in their decision-making process. Browse through this section to gain insight into the verification status of our electrical systems and make informed decisions accordingly.

## [10.0 Lessons Learned ](/lessons-learned)

Here you can take a look on summarized lessons that were learned by the team during the project. The team learned that effective communication, proper planning and organization, flexibility and adaptability, thorough research and prototyping, attention to detail, collaboration and teamwork, failure as a natural part of the learning process, testing and debugging, documentation, and continuous learning and improvement are all crucial factors that contribute to the success of a project. By reflecting on these lessons, future students can better prepare themselves for the challenges that may arise during the course and be more successful in their own projects.
