# **1.0 Team Organization** 

## **1.1 Charter**

As a team, we are planning on applying all the knowledge we gained in
electrical and mechanical skills into a new product. Our team will put
full effort into designing a new environmental sensing product that aids
users and is user friendly.

For goals our group would like to:

  - > Create a product that real world customers would consider using.

  - > Build a high value and efficient product and to be easy to
    > manufacture and access for the user.

  - > Focus on our users and make our product easy to understand and
    > use.

  - > Create a new design/idea in the environmental field that focuses
    > on solving a real challenge.

  - > Challenge ourselves to design and build something that could be
    > included on a resumé.

## **1.2 Product Mission Statement**

Our team mission statement is to improve the clean energy generation
industry, specifically solar energy, and make it more efficient so that
users are able to get the most benefit from their solar energy source.

When coming up with the charter and mission statement for our team we
discussed what we wanted our goals to be first. Once we had an idea for
some of our goals we looked at the project requirements and thought of
what we may want our mission statement and charter to be. When
discussing this we wanted to make sure we emphasized the user
friendliness aspect of a product since we felt that would be one of the
most crucial parts of any design we made. After forming the charter we
then specified our mission statement down to solar energy efficiency.
This was because we started to develop an idea of where we may want our
actual design to be, and what was actually achievable in the semester.

# **2.0 User Needs, Benchmarking and Requirements**

Starting our project by benchmarking all the liked products from the
markets that have specific features. As a team we were looking for
existing products that sense the environment and take action according
to the data gathered. Moreover, our main process to help us find these
products was benchmarking. After every team member finished their
benchmarking we started looking for the positive and negative reviews in
order to take a look at the challenges that are already in the market.
Our goal is to solve one of the issues that will help the environment
positively, not only that take data from it. Based on that we gathered
60 user needs and as a team we added 40 more in a brainstorming session.
After that, the user needs were categorized into two main groups which
are efficiency and user interactions. Next we ranked them from one to 3
which one is the most important need. Below you will go over our steps.

<td>I found that the Hobot 2S was very easy to use. It works best on a window that is not filthy. The cleaning cloth only cleans a small amount of dirt before you need a clean one to replace it. I ordered 3 more cleaning pads and may end up ordering more. Once the dirty to clean ratio of the cleaning cloth is to the clean side, it does a great job and doesn't leave streaks on the window. I think it will be my window bot friend for a long time. I am quite happy with the job that it does.</td>

<td><p>My criticisms will be somewhat technical. But if you want the TL;DR this product just SUCKS. Here's why.</p>
<p>- Turning on the fan is a confusing double press of the "M" key. 1st press turns on the light, 2nd press turns on the fan. Super confusing for guests.</p>
<p>- Menus are labeled by numbers, which you have to cross-reference with the manual to understand what they control. Otherwise, they just look like a bunch of random numbers. No text.</p>
<p>- Humidity sensor requires calibration, otherwise, switch will turn on at the wrong times.</p>
<p>- Switch often does not turn on when the mirror is obviously foggy</p>
<p>----- Technical Feedback -----</p>
<p>This product has a flawed approach to sensing humidity. Humidity is something that fluctuates as part of the weather. A rainy day will trend your indoor humidity higher than a sunny day. The Ortis switch doesn't monitor the room's humidity for these changes. Instead, it keeps it at a setpoint RH%. This means that it's possible for your bathroom fan to run nonstop on a rainy day just because the RH% is higher than your setpoint.</p>
<p>A better approach to this rather than acting like a thermostat is to monitor the room's RH% over a long period of time and look for rapid spikes in humidity, like when you're taking a shower. There are switches the likes of Leviton that do this for you without you having to think about it. It's my belief that a smart switch should make your lifestyle easier, not harder.</p>
<p>Note on usability:</p>
<p>The interface is poorly programmed with menus being represented by numbers and confusing instructions even when you read them word-by-word. If I have to pull out the instructions every time I use it, I can imagine that guests would be intimidated by a switch like this and just never turn on the bathroom fan</p></td>

## **User Needs and Benchmarking Assessment**

At the end of our user needs and benchmarking process we are moving to
the product requirements section. It was important to understand the
concepts on every product that we benchmarked. So based on what our
outcome in the user needs is determining the main requirements of our
product. Overall the steps are becoming more clear for the team to
choose the main challenge we are going to solve.

## **2.2 Product Requirements**

In the product requirement we converted the most ranked needs into
requirements to our project.

**Introduction**

Today renewable energy is playing a huge role in saving the planet and
also acknowledging people about nature. In this project, our team is
going to build a functional robot to sense dust, temperature, and
humidity, and take action to clean any solar panel or tool that needs
regular cleaning for efficiency. Most of us are not aware of how solar
panels play a huge role in reducing the footprint pollution around the
world. As a team we decided to focus and solve a challenge that will
increasingly affect the usage of solar panels.

The project mainly aims to sense and collect data based on how efficient
are solar panels and compare the efficiency before and after the
cleaning. Moreover, it aims to support and increasingly affect solar
panel users and new customers.

**Objectives**

Our project aims to spread the culture of solar panels and make them
more efficient for old and new users. Our main goal is to build an
easy-to-set-up, lightweight, and good-quality solar panel cleaner that
reacts fast whenever it feels a certain quantity of dust. On the other
hand, it will be featured with different sensors such as temperature,
and humidity sensors.

**Stakeholders**

**Target group**

Our target group is the people that have solar panels installed in their
home/company or those looking to install solar panels in the near
future.

**Target purchaser**

Target group profile with attention given to farmers, home-owners and
companies.

**Customer service**

We are aiming to provide good instructions and answers to the most
common questions with the product. Moreover, we are aiming to provide
good quality materials and an easy-to-set-up product.

**Retailers**

Retailers might oversee the projects at the showcase and endorse them to
their company for selling to the public.

**Use Cases**

**User Story \#1: Derock**

Derock is a 52-year-old farmer from the Midwest that wakes up before
sunrise and finishes after sunset. He just recently bought solar panels
to help reduce electricity costs and keep tools charged up for the day.
He is not that technology savvy, but has found that SolarXCL is easy to
use and maintain. When he’s working throughout the day, he knows that he
is getting the maximum efficiency his solar panels will allow. This lets
him work uninterrupted for more productive days.

Occasionally storms will pass through the area and kick-up dirt and mix
with the rainfall to make mud that covers the panels. Derrick has his
SolarXCL setup to automatically detect the newly added grime. When the
storm passes, SolarXCL will clean off the panels again giving Derrick
peace of mind.

**User Story \#2: Vianna**

Vianna is a 36-year-old mother of three. She has two children currently
in primary school, and the third is a toddler still at home. The family
recently got solar panels installed for their home to reduce their
monthly power costs. During the day Vianna takes care of various house
chores, and takes care of the toddler. She likes to unwind by watching
shows or movies on Netflix. She has set up her SolarXCL to detect larger
dirt-piles to make sure it gets cleaned off so their power efficiency is
always as high as possible. This removes one task for her and lets the
family enjoy extra movie nights with the money saved.

The ease-of-use of SolarXCL has made Vianna fall in love with it. She
tells all her friends and neighbors about the product if they ever
choose to get solar panels installed. She has become a long-term
customer.

**User Story \#3: Kei**

Kei is the CEO of a technology company; in one of the tropical countries
he turned his company into an eco-friendly system. He mainly insisted
and focused on having solar panels to power electricity into his
company. During winter and summer seasons he noticed that the AC is not
cooling or heating fast so he asked his team to check the solar system
in his company. Once they did, they saw how some panels were uncleaned
and obviously not efficiently working. He looked online and found our
product SolarXCL. He noticed how the cooling system improved.

## **Product requirement Assessment** 

Overall, the product requirement made our team focus more into solar
panels challenges. Moreover, the seven categories helped intentionally
in building the requirements of our final product. The categories Design
Product, Functionality, Adaptive Intelligence, Interactivity,
Manufacturing, Customization and Safety are our project main focus.
After the process of product requirement we moved into brainstorming
designs ideas and features.

# **3.0 Design Ideation** 

## **3.1 Background and Steps** 

The purpose of these steps is to maximize the number of ideas for our
final product. Using this process we are aiming to get three main
concepts. We started by brainstorming all the ideas, features and styles
of our projects. After that, we categorized the different ideas into
four main categories which are environmental, daily life helper, farmers
and common features . Moreover, we colored every category differently in
order to make it easy to track every idea. Next we ranked all the ideas
in a scale from one to three with one being the most important and three
being the least important. Finally, we started designing our concepts
based on our top ranked ideas.

## **3.2 Brainstorming Steps and Ideas** 

We brainstormed about 100 ideas and project concepts by thinking about
the required features that we generated from the user needs list. We
started with three different empty boards and started to fill them with
the concepts/ideas sticky notes.

## **3.3 Product Concept Sketches** 

**Design concept \#1**

The concept behind this design is to provide the market with fully
equipped and ready to use solar panels. It has sensors to detect the
dust, temperature and humidity. When it detects a certain amount of
humidity or dust it sends signals to the washer system, and the whole
system collaborates to get rid of the extra water and dust. This design
is effective and full of different features.

</div>

</figure>

**Design Concept \#2**

The idea of this concept is a heat emitting robot that moves on the
solar panels after a snow storm to melt the snow from the roof to. When
the robot reads the temperature and wind speed that indicate the end of
the storm for it to start to warm up and melt the snow. It also has a
charging station that is powered by solar panels.

**Design Concept \#3**

A nylon brush attached to a motor and fixture to sweep across a solar
panel. The controller is located underneath the panel and works in
tandem with a humidity sensor and wind speed sensor. This lets the
controller decide a good time to clean based on whether rain is likely
or high winds have blown more dust and debris onto the
panel.

**Design Ideation Assessment**

Overall, the team now has a clear idea of what the final project will
look and function like. The step of design ideation made all of us on
the same page while we were brainstorming and designing. Finally we are
looking for more feedback to make the final decision.

# **Selected Design**

As a team, we chose the third option of our concept designs. Mainly we
focused on building an invention that help solar panels to clean itself
and produce more energy based on it’s temperature readings. On the other
hand, we chose the third concept due to its simplicity with its
features.

# **4.0 Block Diagram**

The electrical system receives an unregulated 9V DC input from Part
*#B08TW9L8VX AC-DC* wall power supply. The 9V input is regulated to 3.3V
using the switching regulator *IC REG* *BUCK 3.3V 2A*. The regulated
output then powers the Microchip *PIC16F15323T-I/SL* microcontroller,
which controls the motors through the *FAN8100N-FS-ND* H-Bridge Driver
through pins RA4/5. The temperature sensor *TC74A4-3.3V* is connected to
the microcontroller using i2c serial communication through pins RA1 and
RA2 which are the SDA and SCL pins. The microcontroller receives data
from the temperature sensor and uses it to control the motors. The block
diagram of the electrical system would show the power supply at the top,
followed by the microcontroller, motor driver, and temperature sensor.
The connections between the components would be indicated by arrows.

**Choice:** 1st Option.

**Rationale:** I worked with that motor before and it was easy to use
and has a very low operation voltage which is 5v. It produces enough
torque as needed and the price is not too high. That is why this is our
chosen option.

**Choice:** 1st Option.

**Rationale:** The second option has more diverse use, but takes up more
space on a board where space is limited. The third option was actually
good, but the cost is far higher than either of the other options and
the output current may become a limiting factor. Due to this the first
option was the best choice for the purposes of our build

*\*\* We will use the 9V power supply from 304 kit “AlloverPower Part
#B08TW9L8VX 9V 3A\*\**

**Software proposal**

For our software proposal we have our main loop which has
initialization, interrupt enable and, the logic of our code. Since we
only have one subsystem beside the microcontroller which is the
temperature sensor or logic is simple. Our loop keeps measuring the
temperature until it is 25 C then it starts the motors to start
cleaning. For our start cleaning loop we run motor 1 and motor2 to move
the brush horizontally.

# <img src="media/image34.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.375in" />

**<u>Fig 14. Software proposal</u>**

# 

# **6.0 Hardware proposal**

For our hardware proposal we have our microcontroller with multiple test
points for programming and debugging purposes. We also have our
switching regulator circuit, temperature sensor and the ICSP plug in for
programming the microcontroller.

## **Communication Procedures**

> Communication between group members will take place on Discord. Thus,
> the team will regularly meet and discuss any updates and plan their
> assignments outline and goals. Moreover, the team will email the
> professor as a communication method with the instructor for guidance
> and inquiries. Zoom/Discord meetings will also be held for updates or
> quick weekday meetups.

## **Meeting Schedule**

Our team availability can be found through this
[<u>link</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1qsL_EHei7h-eo-5rombT-5g8ybxEDRhG_eKkYWFzCa4/edit).
Initially, we are planning to meet Fridays from 3:00 PM until 5:00 PM.
However, our team will try to discuss and work all the main agenda
through the class time. Additionally, we will hold zoom/Discord meetings
on weekdays to discuss any updates and plan in-person meetings.

**Meeting Coordination**

-   We are going to remind each other by the meetings through discord.

-   The meeting time is based on the [<u>schedule of
    > availability</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1qsL_EHei7h-eo-5rombT-5g8ybxEDRhG_eKkYWFzCa4/edit)
    > and discussions at least a week before.

-   Our preferred meeting methode is online through discord/zoom if no
    > in-person work is required.

-   Team members need to notify the team if there were any changes to
    > their availability schedule to ensure that we are all attending
    > the meetings on time.

## **Team Coordination**

-   We set an earlier due date which ranges between 4-24 hours before
    > the actual due date and make sure that every team member is
    > checked off by the time that we set it.

-   We will ask every team member about their knowledge and what part do
    > they think they can do the best based on previous semesters
    > projects or any projects that they did before.

-   The assignments will be reviewed and validated by each team member
    > before submission to ensure that we have everything as it should
    > be.

## **How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members?**

Responsibilities will be discussed among the team members and strengths
will be noted. If no member is strong in an area required by the
project, a team member will be assigned that duty with the expectation
of help from other team members. They will be expected to learn enough
about the responsibility to perform it through the semester.

## **User needs list**

1.  The product should be easy to use/ user friendly

2.  The product should work on multi dirt levels areas not just light

3.  The cleaning area should be bigger/wider
